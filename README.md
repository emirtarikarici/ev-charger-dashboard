# Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger Scenario Dashboard
A decision support system for predicting Electric Vehicles (EVs) charging scenarios in a parking lot.

The working principle of the application is to create a dataset using **uniform and beta distribution** after adding relevant inputs for the scenario that the user wants to see. After pressing the *Refresh Data* button, the application creates a dataset that considers the input values. The application displays the dataset to the user meaningfully through distributions, graphs, and calculations on the dashboard. The last generated dataset can be exported in .xlsx format using the *Save* button.
